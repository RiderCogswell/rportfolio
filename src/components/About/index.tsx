        <p>
          Born and raised in Oak Park, Sacramento + the Tenderloin District of San Francisco, I am not your traditional Software Engineer! I have a degree in Criminal Justice and Ethnic Studies from San Francisco State University, and I attended University of California, Davis Full-Stack Software Development Bootcamp, where I became invested in solving complex real world problems!  I am a chronically curious person, and Software Development has provided me an online community to mix creativity with logic in a fun and always changing way!
